    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>Conceptual design of an IT application</h4>
    <p>A university project focused on conceptually developing an application. My team has worked on a travel
        app that helps people find new destinations within Moldova and can visit anytime by themselves, using
        personal transport. It also helps small businesses, like agrotouristic guest houses, small traditional
        restaurants and traditional arts households get more customers.
        In this project, I have created the branding (logo, colors, fonts) and the wireframes for the app, to show the
        look and feel of it.</p>
    <h4>Bases of developing an application</h4>
    <p>This project focuses on creating a website that displays the menus for the restaurants in Chisinau, as well
        as showing any other additional services or entertainment they provide.
        In this project, I was responsible for creating the branding of our website (logo, colors, fonts) and the
        wireframes for it. I also focused on the business and marketing side of the project, bringing to attention its
        potential impact on the market and making sure it will be able to be sold to potential clients.</p>
